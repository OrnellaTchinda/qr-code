## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles




### Continued development

I chose this project to start with my web development portfolio. I had some issues that I hope will get help for. I plan on learning more about flexbox. I realise how much I enjoy working with and how tricky it can be. I can wait to jump onto future projects and also get used to github.

### Useful resources

- [Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for css flexbox. I downloaded the poster and I am keeping it for future uses.
